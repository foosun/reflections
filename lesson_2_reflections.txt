What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To indicate that I want to use git on that particular project. No initialization, no git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It stores the temporary files you want to set for commit. It's generally a place where you can decide again for good to commit or not to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Always check against the master copy using the git status, git --staged and git diff commands
test stagesvsrepo, workingfilevsstaged

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Not sure. It keeps separate track development clear of the master development.
