When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For backup and collaboration (if applicable) via the Internet / cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So as not to mess the progress on both local and remote repository and leave the decision to the user to commit changes as and when needed.
